# Regression practice
This repository focuses on implementing and evaluating supervised learning models, specifically regression techniques. The lab explores both linear and polynomial regression, emphasizing model training, evaluation using key metrics, and data visualization.

## Task 1: 
Implement a basic Linear Regression model, predict a target variable from CSV data, and evaluate its performance using standard metrics.

## Task 2: 
Apply Polynomial Regression to model non-linear relationships (e.g., house size vs. price) and evaluate its effectiveness.


## Skills Obtained:
- Regression Modeling
- Model Evaluation
- Data Handling and Preprocessing
- Data Visualization

This lab has provided a solid foundation in implementing, evaluating, and visualizing both linear and polynomial regression models, along with crucial data handling and testing practices.
